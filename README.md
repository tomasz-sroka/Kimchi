# Kimchi Recipe
First, you’ll need a fermentation jar. I’m using Kilner Fermentation Set 3 Liters, and I’m quite happy with it.<br/>
Do not clean it in the dishwasher, as it might break.

## Ingredients:

2 Chinese cabbages<br/>
Salt<br/><br/>
0.5–1 kg carrots<br/>
2 white radishes<br/>
optional your favourie vegetable or fruit<br/><br/>
1 head of garlic<br/>
5–10 cm of ginger<br/>
Soy sauce<br/>
Chili (to taste)<br/><br/>
Turmeric<br/><br/>
## Instructions:

Take a large pot or bowl.<br/>

Shred the cabbage and sprinkle it with salt.<br/>

Let it rest for at least 30 minutes to allow the cabbage to release water. Be patient; don’t rush this step.

While the cabbage is resting, shred the carrots and white radish and whatever you decide to add.<br/>

Once the cabbage has released enough water, mix in the shredded carrots and radish.<br/>

Blend the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, chili, and turmeric into a smooth paste.<br/>

Add a little water if the mixture is too thick.<br/>

Add tumeric and the paste to the cabbage. Mix all the ingredients thoroughly.<br/>

Transfer the mixture to the fermentation jar, layer by layer. After adding each layer, press it down firmly.<br/>
By the end, the water should completely cover the kimchi.<br/>

Cover the kimchi with stones or weights, pressing them gently to ensure the water rises slightly and fully covers the mixture.<br/>
Clean the sides and top of the jar with paper to remove any leftover bits of kimchi.<br/>
![IMG_0846](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c342662-5053-43ce-bd63-e72b28882e6e)
Close the jar with the lid and store it at room temperature in a dark place.<br/>

Allow the kimchi to ferment for 7 to 10 days. The fermentation time will depend on the temperature. After about 10 days, you can take out some to enjoy. Let the remaining kimchi continue fermenting for a few more days before taking out another portion. For the third batch, leave it in the jar for over two weeks to develop a deeper, more complex flavor.
