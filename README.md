# Kimchi Recipe:

First, you’ll need a fermentation jar. I’m using this one: Kilner Fermentation Set 3 Liters, and I’m quite happy with it. <br/>
Do not clean it in the dishwasher—it will break.

## Ingredients:

2 Chinese cabbages<br/>
Salt<br/>
0.5–1 kg carrots<br/>
2 white radishes<br/>
1 head of garlic<br/>
5–10 cm of ginger<br/>
Soy sauce<br/>
Chili (to taste)<br/>
Turmeric<br/>

## Instructions:

Use a large pot or bowl. Shred the cabbage and add some salt. Let it sit for at least half an hour to allow the cabbage to release water.<br/>
Be patient and don’t rush this step.<br/><br/>
While the cabbage is resting, shred the carrots and white radish. Once the cabbage has released enough water, add the shredded carrots and radish to it.<br/><br/>
Blend the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, chili, and turmeric into a paste. Add some water if the mixture is too thick.<br/>
Mix everything thoroughly and transfer the mixture to the fermentation jar.<br/><br/>
Let the kimchi ferment for 7 to 10 days. The exact time will depend on the temperature.<br/>
After approximately 10 days, you can take out some of the kimchi to enjoy. Allow the rest to continue fermenting for a few more days before taking out another portion. For the third batch, leave it in the jar for more than two weeks for a stronger, more complex flavor.
